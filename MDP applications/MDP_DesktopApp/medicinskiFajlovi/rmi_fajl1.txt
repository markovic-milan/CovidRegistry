stub
The stub is an object, acts as a gateway for the client side. All the outgoing requests are routed through it. It resides at the client side and represents the remote object. When the caller invokes method on the stub object, it does the following tasks:

It initiates a connection with remote Virtual Machine (JVM),
It writes and transmits (marshals) the parameters to the remote Virtual Machine (JVM),
It waits for the result
It reads (unmarshals) the return value or exception, and
It finally, returns the value to the caller.
